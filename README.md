### This work is part of operating system assignment.

In these two question, we were supposed to used threads for concurrency
and use mutex locks and semaphores to avoid deadlock.

### BIRYANI:
Created mutex lock for each table and student.

### CABS:
Used two semaphores, one for cabs and other for payment servres.

Created thread for each cab and each payment server.
